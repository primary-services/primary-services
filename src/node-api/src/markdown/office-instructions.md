# Volunteer Instructions

### What are we doing?

Collecting the information about every elected position in every city and town in Massachusetts into one place: the Democracy Hub.


### Why are we doing this?

We believe that good governance begins with competitive elections, but many local races go uncontested. By gathering information about what seats are up for election next year and what the requirements are to run, we can begin to see where MA citizens can step into community and power.
Wait, does this already exist? No, there is no one place to look up all elected positions in MA, especially municipal (local/city/town-based elections)

### What exactly am *I* doing?

You’ll search the internet (generally a city’s website) for information to add to the hub. You, our brave beta testers, have two jobs: 

1. Fill in the information for a city in MA.
2. Give us feedback on the process of #1, so we can make this process smooth enough		for a cadre of volunteers to gather ALL the office information from across the state. 

### What do I do if I get stuck?

Sonya and Natalie are available to answer questions and listen to whatever comes up as you’re poking at this process, in the [group Signal chat](https://signal.group/#CjQKIAb9Re-KJ-wuN__Rx6QIboeJjtzhQ9Mtrwu9b361y9z1EhA_5v83A09RC8ypHfK6Xf_X) or via DM to Sonya.

## #1 How to fill in information for a city

### Choose a city

1. First, choose a city from our [checklist of cities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d4eHMwQLlPJGJvA7URVZ9ZICRqVVCny_uu6mj2j5a4Q/edit?usp=sharing) and change the status (column A) to started. 
2. Add your name to the _Updater_ column (column B).
3. Fill in data about the city.

*If you don’t complete all the data for a city, that’s OK. If you plan on coming back to it, make a note to say that. If you decide you’re done volunteering for the time being, keep your name in the Updater column, and add a note saying the entry needs finishing.*

### Go to the Hub 

1. Go to the [Democracy Hub city list](https://admin.deadlykitten.com/towns)
2. On the left, select the city you chose
3. You are now on the landing page for that city! This is where the magic happens.

*Yes, the domain is currently hosted at [deadlykitten.com](https://deadlykitten.com), at least for right meow.*

### Add that sexy municipal information 

You are focusing on finding the elected offices this city has, and inputting them into the Hub. Literally any elected office goes here. There is a huge variety in the jobs each city has, and which of those jobs are elected vs appointed. You’re bringing order to that chaos! 

*_But Don’t Add Everything_: please note that you are not entering appointed information. And, you aren’t entering post-election appointments. For example, if after the city council is elected they appoint or elect a council president internally, we aren’t including this. This is just about things citizens can vote for.*

### Where to find the office information

It’s like catching Pokemon – they’re not easy to see, but once you start roaming around you’ll run into them, and you can catch ‘em all. Here’s where to look:
- Town Charters: for office names and number of seats
- Annual Town Reports: for current officials and their term start/end dates
- City Website: for a list of current officials 
- News Sites: to find when the most recent election happened

### To add an office

- Select “+” symbol next to Offices
- Under Office Description heading, enter:
	- Title: for example, city clerk, school committee, mayor etc. 
	- Number of Seats: for example, the school committee may have 10 seats 
	- Term Length (in years): for example, a mayor may serve for 4 years
		- For each office type, you’ll add that in here, so if a city had 3 different offices, you’d make three separate entries including the title, number of seats, and term length for each.
- Once you add a number of seats, you’ll be given places to add info for each seat
- Enter in for each seat:
		- Incumbent name
		- Term start
		- Term end will already be filled out based on term start and term length
- Save
- Add your source(s) - maybe do this along the way, as you look about the area for the Pokemon city offices.

#### Running into exceptions to the standards
Of *course* there was going to be exceptions. We're collecting them as they show up (if you find a new one, let us know!) and share what to do:
- Vacant seat: sometimes there's an office, but it's vacant! Please add the seat, and in the Incumbent name field, write "vacancy".

*Need to edit? From the landing page for the city, select the pencil icon to the left of the office title. Once in that editing page, you can edit any of the information. Clicking on the city name should bring you back there, or go find it at the [city list page.](https://admin.deadlykitten.com/towns)*

### To add Sources

We’re tracking where exactly (like, the exact URL) where we find the office information, because it varies from city to city. 

- Select “+” symbol next to Offices
- Under Summary: write the title of the website/document as best you can describe it
- Under URL: paste the URL to that website/document
- When you’re done, click on the blue checkmark

*As an example, for [Abington MA](https://admin.deadlykitten.com/towns/ma/abington), the information was found in their town charter, and the 2021 Annual Report.*

### To add Notes

This is a place to add anything you encountered that was confusing, incomplete for a reason beyond your control, or anything else you’d like to leave for the next volunteer who is double checking or updating the page. These are admin-only notes, they will not be made public.

*Here’s an example of notes for [Adams, MA].(https://admin.deadlykitten.com/towns/ma/adams)*

One type of information that we need to add here is because some offices span multiple municipalities (like school committees for a district). For now, our system requires you to enter manually for each city. If you do run into this, please add a note in the notes section.

If you encounter bugs that mean the site won’t save or show the correct information, include the correct information as a note.


*For example, if you encountered a bug that wouldn’t let you edit the number of seats so the current number of seats showing is incorrect.*

### Wrap up your city

You’ve added stuff! This is great! You’ve added offices, the sources you found the information, and any notes for Future Volunteer.

Go back to our [checklist of cities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d4eHMwQLlPJGJvA7URVZ9ZICRqVVCny_uu6mj2j5a4Q/edit?usp=sharing). 

If you’ve found and entered all of the offices for your city, great! Click the **Done** checkbox (column A).

If you haven’t entered all of the info for your city, that’s ok. Use the **Notes** line (column C) to say either:

- Not completed, I’ll come back to it
- Needs completing by someone

And you’re done with that city! Also, can we also have your feedback??

## #2 How to give us feedback

### Take a few diary notes about your experience

We want to absorb as much information as we can from your experience, so we can offer this to a wide variety of people to help. That means we need to have clear instructions, and that folks can complete the task without needing help. This is where you come in. Any feedback is welcome, and we’re especially interested in feedback like these prompts:

- “The instructions didn’t make sense because…” or “The instructions were wrong because…”
- “I felt frustrated when …”
- “I couldn’t figure out how to …”

You could write these down and either share them privately (DM Sonya in Signal) or add them to the Democracy Hub volunteer Signal group. Sonya and Natalie will be there, helping with anything that you get stuck on. You’re welcome to chat with each other about the experience if you’d like to. You’re the few rad souls to be joining in doing this work, before we open the gates!

### Encountering Bugs

If you encounter a bug (the website working different than you thought it is supposed to), please report it using the Google form, so the people making the website can look at it: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekaJ1HUhgOj8M8gf6WsTKzslsCQXw7R8wGQh-swqlHv1QSww/viewform

- You’re an “Admin”
- You can also find this link when you’re within a city’s landing page under the “Report a Bug” link at the top right

If you’re new to bug reports, and have questions how to fill this out, ask in the [Signal cha](https://signal.group/#CjQKIAb9Re-KJ-wuN__Rx6QIboeJjtzhQ9Mtrwu9b361y9z1EhA_5v83A09RC8ypHfK6Xf_X) t or DM Sonya in Signal, your choice.
